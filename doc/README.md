XIM Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[XIM Core](http://ximblock.org/wallet) is the original XIM client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of XIM transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run XIM on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/ximblock-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/ximblockd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/ximblock-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/ximblockd (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run ximblock-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag XIM-Qt to your applications folder, and then run XIM-Qt.
